During my time in college I worked on a number of projects and assignments including: 

- A program written in **Java** to analyse the language in a piece of text and determine wether the language and grammar used is formal or informal. 

- A **website** for a pizza delivery restaurant using **Apache web server, PHP, HTML, CSS**. Users could, browse a menu, log in/out, checkout, orders stored in db, menu items stored in db with prices etc. 

- A **website** with another student for a pharmacy using **Apache web server, PHP, HTML, Javascript, CSS**. Users could -create an account -log in/out -live search for products in an inventory -View profile with customer details and profile picture stored in DB. Website admins can -update the inventory create/update/delete.

- An **Android** application aimed at cyclists for storing and viewing their data on different mountain climbs.

- A **Python** program to convert the Airplane_Crashes.csv collection to be stored by year of the crash in a one to many design in a MongoDB database.

- A Procedurally generated city in **Unity Games Engine** containing a reasonable variation of buildings, streets and other objects that might be found in a city.

During my internship with SAP I gained a lot of valuable experience with cloud infrastructure, using SAP cloud platform and developing an app on SAPâ€™s Fiori platform using SAPUI5 HTML5 framework. 

## Final Year Project
The goal of my project was to create a game involving a basic self-driving car AI, a human player and a procedurally generated city environment within Unity 3D. The AI was created using C# scripts. 
 
The design of the game is:
- Procedurally generate a city using perlin noise.
- For the player to navigate the environment while searching for a goal point and avoiding the rogue self driving car.
- The rogue self-driving car to patrol the environment, search for the player and pursue if in its line of sight.

I was met with some issues and was limited on time with my project. In the end the AI was not fully functional and was quite buggy. I plan on continuing the development of this project in the future and to polish and publish it on a public platform to recieve feedback.
