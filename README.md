During my time in college I worked on a number of projects and assignments including: 

- A program written in **Java** to analyse the language in a piece of text and determine wether the language and grammar used is formal or informal. 

- A **website** for a pizza delivery restaurant using **Apache web server, PHP, HTML, CSS**. Users could, browse a menu, log in/out, checkout, orders stored in db, menu items stored in db with prices etc. 

- A **website** with another student for a pharmacy using **Apache web server, PHP, HTML, Javascript, CSS**. Users could -create an account -log in/out -live search for products in an inventory -View profile with customer details and profile picture stored in DB. Website admins can -update the inventory create/update/delete.

- An **Android** application aimed at cyclists for storing and viewing their data on different mountain climbs.

- A **Python** program to convert the Airplane_Crashes.csv collection to be stored by year of the crash in a one to many design in a MongoDB database.

- A Procedurally generated city in **Unity Games Engine** containing a reasonable variation of buildings, streets and other objects that might be found in a city.

During my internship with SAP I gained a lot of valuable experience with cloud infrastructure, using SAP cloud platform and developing an app on SAP‚Äôs Fiori platform using SAPUI5 HTML5 framework. 

## Final Year Project

The goal of my project was to create a game involving a basic self-driving car AI, a human player and a procedurally generated city environment within Unity 3D. The AI was created using C# scripts.  

  

The design of the game is: 

- Procedurally generate a city using perlin noise. 

- For the player to navigate the environment while searching for a goal point and avoiding the rogue self driving car. 

- The rogue self-driving car to patrol the environment, search for the player and pursue if in its line of sight. 

 

I was met with some issues and was limited on time with my project. I‚Äôm currently still working on the project in my spare time. Currently the game is playable and most of the features are functional. I am still working to get the Ai to the specifications I originally planned on. The Ai will patrol the city randomly but it will not yet pursue the player when in its line of sight this is the most dificult part of the project and I plan on getting it finished soon.
