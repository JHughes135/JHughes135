- A program written in **Java** to analyse the language in a piece of text and determine wether the language and grammar used is formal or informal. 

- A **website** for a pizza delivery restaurant using **Apache web server, PHP, HTML, CSS**. Users could, browse a menu, log in/out, checkout, orders stored in db, menu items stored in db with prices etc. 

- A **website** with another student for a pharmacy using **Apache web server, PHP, HTML, Javascript, CSS**. Users could -create an account -log in/out -live search for products in an inventory -View profile with customer details and profile picture stored in DB. Website admins can -update the inventory create/update/delete.
